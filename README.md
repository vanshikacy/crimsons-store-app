# Crimsons
Your boutique for high-end heels, reimagined. ðŸ‘ âœ¨

Crimsons is a personal e-commerce project where I showcase a small, curated collection of luxury heels and accessories. The idea was to combine elegance with smooth functionality: users can scroll through featured products, view low-res images for fast loading, and see high-res images for full detail.  

ðŸ›’ **Cart & Checkout:** The cart is fully interactiveâ€”you can add, update, or remove products on the fly. Stripe handles secure payments, redirects users to a smooth checkout page, and automatically tracks all transactions.  

ðŸ’» **Tech & Flow:** Built with Next.js for routing across cart, checkout, success, and error pages, and React for state management and dynamic user interactions. Includes high-res / low-res image management, scrollable product display, and an email signup at the bottom for potential future newsletters.  

ðŸš€ **Key Features:**  
- Elegant, luxury-inspired design  
- Scrollable curated product showcase  
- Dynamic cart with quantity management  
- Stripe-powered checkout with automated payment tracking  
- Next.js routing & React state management  
- Email signup for future newsletters  

ðŸ›  **Tech Stack:** HTML, CSS, JS, Next.js + React, Stripe API
